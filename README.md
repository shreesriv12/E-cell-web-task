i implemented the above given tasks using vite + tailwind css using tailwind utitlity class for css
Created a home/first page where I completed the required tasks of creating a navbar with the three links and doing their functionality by clicking on them and the three div container one for filling it with background using linear gradient second for containing the E-cell logo and the third for storing the 9 boxes. I use the useState() to change thr color of the div 
I initially set it to false, on clicking te required div the handleClick() changes the state of setActive() and the color changes to blue.

i created a Link to second page  which contains my details such as name,picture ,registration number and a button which redirects to the main instagram handle etc
i took help from some resources and tutorials for the css designing such as box shadow and circle designing.
